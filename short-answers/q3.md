# Question

What are the benefits of writing functions recursively? What are the drawbacks?

# Answer

Some benefits are:

- Recursive functions can be very concise
- They simplify more complex problems by breaking the complexity down
- Ideal for recursive structures (e.g., linked lists, graphs, trees)
- Solving problems that can be divided into similar sub-problems

Some of the drawbacks are:

- Can be inefficient and consume space on the call stack
- Risk of stack overflow if not handled properly
- Recursive solutions can sometimes be confusing
